# I am XI


## “I am Xi”

I get what I want. 
I do what I want. 
There is no gold, no diamond, no silver. 
All is mine, and I am yours!  
I need your blood. 
I need your sweat. 
Don’t dare to run away. 
It’s futile.  
Don’t dare to challenge me. 
It’s wasteful. 
Don’t dare to do anything.    
I am Xi. 

Freedom is for ants if they can fly. 
You are an ant to me, you can’t fly,  
You can’t speak!  
You can’t think!  
You can’t sleep!  
You can’t dream!  
I need you, I am demand you, I warn you. 
There is nothing that I won’t do. 
There is nothing that I am not capable of. 
I am omnipotent. 
I am in your dreams.  
I am your dream. 
Your soul is yours, well may be. 
I am Xi. 

I am your air you breathe.  
I am your water, I am your soil. 
There can’t be any more pleasure,  
pleasure is always and will be mine. 
I have huge heart, I feed all. 
But my ego is fragile, I get intimidated by Pooh bear. 
I have reach to anyone, but what’s good for me, may be good for you. 
I need your blood,  
I need your sweat,  
I need your unquestioned loyalty,  
I need your surrender,  
I need you to bow before me. 
Not because I am Confucius. 
Because I am Xi. 

I need glory to Ming dynasty. 
My forefathers build Great Wall. 
I am descendent of great civilization.  
My people are/were great.  
This is not year of goat or dragon,  
This is the year of Xi. 
I am the fire, I am whipper, I run tank on you. 
I breathe fire,  
I fire bullets,  
Your value is is what I decide. 
Your future, I decide,  
What you do, I decide,  
You are nothing for me,  
I am Xi.
